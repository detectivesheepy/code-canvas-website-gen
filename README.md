# CodeCanvas

## What is CodeCanvas?
CodeCanvas is an AI website builder, operated and built entirely by AI.

## How does it work?
CodeCanvas' GUI is built using [Lovable](lovable.dev) and the websites are generated entirely using AI. On the 12/4/2025 we will be using ChatGPT to generate models, but as you need an API key, we will soon be using DeepSeek.

## Where can I find it?
CodeCanvas is only avaliable on Vercel. The Vercel site link is [code-canvas-website-gen.vercel.app](code-canvas-website-gen.vercel.app).
